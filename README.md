**Student Name: Eray Kocabozdoğan
**Student ID: 280201055

This repository contains the solutions for the CENG 543 Information Retrieval Take-Home Midterm Examination.

## Project Structure

* `Ceng543_Q1.ipynb`: Question 1 - Comparative Analysis of BiLSTM/BiGRU with GloVe/BERT.
* `Ceng543_Q2.ipynb`: Question 2 - Implementation of Bahdanau, Luong, and Dot-Product Attention.
* `Ceng543_Q3.ipynb`: Question 3 - Transformer vs Seq2Seq models & Ablation Study.
* `Ceng543_Q4.ipynb`: Question 4 - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using BM25 & FLAN-T5.
* `Ceng543_Q5.ipynb`: Question 5 - Interpretability analysis and failure cases.
* `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the notebooks.

## How to Run

All notebooks are developed and tested on **Google Colab** using a T4 GPU.

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Open the notebooks in Jupyter or upload them to Google Colab.
4.  Ensure you have the necessary API tokens (e.g., Hugging Face) if required for downloading models.

## Notes
* The results, plots, and metrics are pre-executed and visible in the notebooks.
